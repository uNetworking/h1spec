### How to run
Hit `make` and see what happens (runs on Linux and macOS; deno, nodejs and bun should be installed).

The server being tested should echo back whatever HTTP body it gets, for all HTTP methods.

If your server runs on localhost:8000 you run `deno run --allow-net http_test.ts localhost 8000`

### Example output
The test will run for at most 500ms but will finish immediately if the server is up to spec.
